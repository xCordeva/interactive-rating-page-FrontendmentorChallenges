## Overview
This aim to this project was to create an interactive rating system, it allows the user to choose a number between 1 and 5 and displays a thank-you message along with the chosen rating.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

This project was a challenge for me the whole process went so smooth tell I came to the point where I had to make the hover effect work while I have a rating option already selected, I had to brain storm and google a lot till I came wiht the solution that I used, I think there is a better solution for this problem but I am satisfied with what I came with for now.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- DOM manipulation with JavaScript


### What I learned

- **Hover Effects:** I learned how to add hover effects on both selected and unselected ratings.

- **Event Listeners:** learned how to use event listeners like `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` to manage the hover states.


### Continued development

While I am satisfied with the current solution, I intend to explore alternative methods for handling hover effects through JavaScript.
